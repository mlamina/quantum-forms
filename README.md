## 🎨 Martial Arts Philosophy

- **Tae Kwon Do** - Korean martial art emphasizing kicks
- **Wing Chun** - Chinese kung fu focusing on close combat
- **Judo** - Japanese art of throws and grappling

Each belt represents a different element and stage of growth:
- **White Belt** (Beginner's Mind) - Snow, emptiness, blank slate
- **Yellow Belt** (Growth) - Seed scattered on ground, patience
- **Green Belt** (Earth) - Grounding and foundation
- **Blue Belt** (Air) - Learning to fly, soaring to new heights

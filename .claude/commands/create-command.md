# create-command

Create a new command file in the .claude/commands/ directory.
A "command" is a markdown file that describes a specific task or workflow in the project, providing instructions and examples for how to execute it.
The instructions in the command file you are creating will be used by Claude Code to understand and execute project-specific commands.

## How to Create a Command

2. Create a new markdown file in `.claude/commands/` with a descriptive name


## Notes

Commands in this directory help Claude Code understand project-specific workflows and can be referenced during development tasks.
Use existing commands as templates for new ones. If anything is unclear, ask for clarification.
